# Viral Validation Form with Dynamic Submit Button
This project aims to create an engaging and interactive HTML form with CSS and JavaScript that dynamically moves the submit button when the user submits invalid data. This not only enhances user experience but also encourages users to correct their input. The project utilizes HTML for form structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior.

## Demo:
A live demo of the project can be found [here](https://hassanmahfuj.github.io/moving-validation-form/).

## Key Features:
- Interactive Form: A user-friendly HTML form for data submission.
- Dynamic Submit Button: The submit button's position is adjusted based on the validation result.
- Validation Logic: JavaScript validates user input and dynamically responds to validation results.
- Customizable Styling: The CSS is fully customizable to match your project's design.

## How It Works:
1. Form Structure: The HTML file defines the form structure with input fields and a submit button.
2. CSS Styling: CSS is used to style the form and make it visually appealing.
3. JavaScript Validation: JavaScript is responsible for validating user input. When the user submits invalid data, the submit button's position dynamically moves to provide feedback.
4. Dynamic Animation: Depending on validation results, the submit button may move up or down and display a message indicating the reason for the invalid input.

## Usage:
